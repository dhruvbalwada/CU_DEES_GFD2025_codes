# CU_DEES_GFD2025_codes
Code for some numerical experiments for teaching GFD.


## Install tips
Follow the steps in https://dedalus-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/installation.html#full-stack-conda-installation-recommended to the dot (almost, see next note), and hopefully everything will work. 

Instead of using `conda install -c conda-forge dedalus` in step 5, use `conda install -c conda-forge dedalus jupyterlab`. This will allow you to be able to use jupyter notebooks, which will help with the homeworks.
